Alright alright alright, let's get those front-end skills to life. 

### Goals 

- [X] Fetch predefined movies and load them on mount.
- [ ] Make the input controlled to fetch movies later based on the title.
- [ ] Upon fetching searched movies, the predefined rendered ones should disappear 
and the searched on should be rendered. (More scenarios that I will work on later)
